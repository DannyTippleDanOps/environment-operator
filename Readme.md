# Environment operator

The purpose of Environment Operator is to provide a seamless application deployment capability for a given environment within Kubernetes. It can easily hook into existing CI/CD pipeline capabilities including our [CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/pearsontechnology/deployment-pipeline-jenkins-plugin) as well as a typical Jenkins server through a [Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/pearsontechnology/environment-operator-jenkins-plugin). The code is 100% open source and merge requests will be gladly accepted.
